Current smartphone VR sets are less immersive than PC or console ones.   Compatibility. If using a PC-based VR system, users must make sure the computer meets gaming system's qualifications in areas such as graphics cards and processing power.       Resolution. It's important to have a high-resolution headset to have a realistic VR experience. Resolution per eye is the metric used to measure headset resolution. It denotes the number of pixels the headset can display.   Field of view. This metric describes how much of the virtual environment is visible to the viewer at any one time. A higher field of view creates a more immersive experience.    Refresh rate. This is measured in frames per second (FPS) and dictates the smoothness of an image. A low FPS rate can cause motion sickness.        Tracking. Positional tracking aligns a user's physical movement with in-game movement. Virtual reality systems that provide one-to-one positional tracking avoid in-game delays.             Physical space. VR gaming usually requires the user to move around in physical space to act out actions in the virtual world. Users must ensure they have a suitable space to play virtual games so as not to injure themselves.Physical conditions. Although technology is improving, VR systems have the potential to induce nausea. Some also warn people with epilepsy against using them."
